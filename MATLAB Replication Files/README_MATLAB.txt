MIDIS 

MATLAB Replication Files

 - midis.m uses source data files to compute MIDIS for 120 countries in the sample.

 - midis_figs_tabs.m uses midis.mat to create Fig. 2 and Tab. 1.

 - midis_robust_me_mf.m creates the robustness results with fixed multiplication factors.

 - midis_robust_me_mf_tv.m creates the robustness results with time-varying multiplication factors.

 - midis_robust_me.m draws Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.

 - midis_robust_alfa.m implements the analysis with different (alpha) values.
   
 - midis_robust_robust_100thCase.m implements the analysis for the 30-day episode after the 100th case.
 
 - midis_robust_60days.m implements the analysis for the 60-day episode after the 500th case.
  
 - midis_figs_tabs_robust.m uses various mat files to draw Figures A.1, A.2 and A.3.
